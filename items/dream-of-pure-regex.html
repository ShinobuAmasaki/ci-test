         <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
         <p>In the next major release of Fortran Regular Expression
         library, I aim to provide <code>pure</code> operators and a
         <code>pure</code> procedure.</p>
         <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
         <p>One of my recent personal projects is Forgex—Fortran Regular
         Expression. <a
         href="https://github.com/ShinobuAmasaki/forgex/releases/tag/v2.0">The
         latest version, version 2.0</a>, is still under development. It
         has implemented Lazy DFA and released its documentation. In
         this version, the regular expression engine utilizes modern
         Fortran features, particularly modules, object-oriented
         programming, and pointers. Within the engine, regular
         expressions are parsed using module variables of derived-types,
         and matching is achieved by constructing an abstract syntax
         tree (AST), an equivalent non-deterministic finite automaton
         (NFA), and an equivalent deterministic finite automaton
         (DFA).</p>
         <p>In the next version of the project, one of the goals is to
         support parallelization. There are two possible approaches to
         parallelize within the library (although I’m not sure if the
         first one is feasible):</p>
         <ul>
         <li>parallelizing the construction of automata,</li>
         <li>parallelizing the matching process.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The first approach involves the challenge of parallelizing
         the process of constructing an NFA from an AST and a DFA from
         an NFA. I’m not sure if this is even theoretically possible. If
         any readers have information on this, please let me know (<a
         href="https://github.com/ShinobuAmasaki/ShinobuAmasaki.github.io/issues">feel
         free to contact me through GitHub issue page</a>).</p>
         <p>The second approach is simpler. The <code>.in.</code>
         operator and <code>regex</code> procedure shift the text string
         to be matched from the beginning to the right by one character
         at a time, trying to match, so in theory, this process can be
         parallelized by the length of the string. However, this
         approach cannot be applied to the <code>.match.</code>operator.
         Additionally, the potential for parallelization will be limited
         when the optimization by literal search[1, 2], which is planned
         for future implementation, is incorporated.</p>
         <p>I initially considered these approaches, but after
         reassessing the assumption that users would benefit from
         parallelization, I realized that parallelization did not need
         to be achieved within the library. The <code>.in.</code>,
         <code>.match.</code> and <code>regex</code> procedures provided
         by the library depend only on two arguments—a pattern and text
         string—and their results are determined without side effects.
         In Fortran, procedures that have the properties of pure
         functions can be written with the <code>pure</code> attribute.
         These can be used in <code>do concurrent</code> constructs,
         allowing the compiler to partially optimize the code block. In
         other words, by implementing thread-safe procedures, users will
         be able to handle parallelization themselves.</p>
         <p>Therefore, the goal of Forgex version 3 is to rewrite the
         code, giving all procedures the <code>pure</code> attribute,
         and to provide <code>pure</code> <code>.in.</code> and
         <code>.match.</code> operators, as well as
         <code>pure subroutine regex</code> (which are
         <code>function</code> in v2.0). To achieve this, the following
         changes will be added:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>Remove pointers and module variables from the
         implementation of AST, NFA, and DFA.</li>
         <li>Implement the construction and processing of these using
         arrays of derived-types with index management.</li>
         <li>Allow reverse transitions in DFA for <strong>literal search
         optimization</strong> [1, 2] which I intend to implement in a
         later version.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Finally, almost all of the source code will be rewritten,
         but since Forgex v2.0 is only about 3000 lines, I don’t expect
         it to be too difficult. As of July 24, about 80% of the new AST
         construction has been written, so if all goes well, I should be
         able to release version 3 within this year.</p>
         <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
         <p>Here’s what I’m planning for the next version of Forgex:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>Provide <code>pure</code> operators (<code>.in.</code> and
         <code>.match.</code>) and a subroutine
         (<code>regex</code>).</li>
         <li>Remove pointers and module variables, implement arrays of
         derived-types.</li>
         <li>Allow for future extensions to implement literal search
         optimization.</li>
         </ul>
