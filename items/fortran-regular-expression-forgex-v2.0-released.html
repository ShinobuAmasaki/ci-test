         href="https://github.com/ShinobuAmasaki/forgex/releases/tag/v2.0">Forgex
         v2.0 with Lazy DFA is available.</a></p>
         <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
         <p>I have released version 2.0 of Forgex (short for Fortran
         Regular Expression), and <a
         href="https://github.com/ShinobuAmasaki/forgex">it is now
         available on GitHub.</a></p>
         <p>Starting with this version, I have adopted a lazy-evaluated
         deterministic finite automaton (Lazy DFA) approach for subset
         construction, which has reduced the consumption of time and
         memory resources compared to using previous statically compiled
         DFA.</p>
         <p>As a minor fix, I have added the <code>forgex_</code> prefix
         to the names of all internal modules. This prevents module name
         collisions when introducing Forgex into a new project. The API
         module name <code>forgex</code> and the APIs of
         <code>.in.</code> and <code>.match.</code> operators, and
         <code>regex</code> function will remain unchanged.</p>
         <p>Thank you.</p>

         <h2 id="to-do">To Do</h2>
         <p>Here are some of the things I am considering for the future
         of this project:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>improving documentation of the internal implementation for
         developers (<em>top priority</em>),</li>
         <li>optimizing with a literal search method,</li>
         <li>supporting escape sequences for Unicode,</li>
         <li>Parallelizing matching.</li>
         </ul>
         <h2 id="memo">Memo</h2>
         <p><em>The following are just my own thoughts and notes, so I
         cannot guarantee their accuracy.</em></p>
         <h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
         <p>​ I am trying to decide where to place and how to build the
         documentation for my Fortran project. Should I put it in the
         main repository or create a separate repository for the
         documentation? Should I use FORD or Sphinx? FORD is very easy
         to use as it automatically generates the reference
         documentation, but I am considering Sphinx because of the wide
         selection of visual themes and good typesetting.</p>
         <h3 id="regex-literals-optimization">Regex Literals
         Optimization</h3>
         <p>​ The regex literals optimization is a method which avoids
         executing the regex engine on parts of the input character
         string that cannot possibly match the regex pattern (cf. [5]).
         I need to think in advance about which part of the engine this
         feature should be implemented in. Since I want to avoid
         changing the syntax tree construction as much as possible,
         would it be better to implement this naively in a relatively
         shallow layer, in a module close to the users and API?</p>
         <h3 id="parallelization">Parallelization</h3>
         <p>​ The thread parallelization of regex engines can be
         discussed in two parts: DFA construction and matching.
         Parallelizing DFA construction will undoubtedly be difficult.
         Care must be taken to avoid race conditions. On the other hand,
         parallelizing matching is more realistic, and is possible if I
         prepare as many pointer variables as there are threads, with
         the upper limit being the number of starting points for
         matching. In other words, the <code>.in.</code> operator and
         the <code>regex</code> function can be parallelized, but the
         <code>.match.</code> operator cannot.</p>
         <p>​ The above discussion pertains to <strong>static</strong>
         DFA construction. However, in Lazy DFA, it will be necessary to
         balance both of these, that is, to avoid race conditions during
         matching and execute DFA construction in parallel. At this
         point, I don’t know whether this is possible or not, so I need
         to learn by reading computer science papers and studying other
         implementations of regex engines.</p>
         <p>Nonetheless, even if I were to implement it to this extent,
         it is unclear whether I could expect any significant from
         parallelization.</p>
         <h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
         <ul>
         <li>I would like to implement escape sequences for Unicode,
         adopting a notation that is widely used in other engines. But
         which one should I use?</li>
         <li>I would like to have more effective testing methods and a
         sufficient number of test cases.]</li>
         </ul>
